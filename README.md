## Clean Architecture with MVVM

This repository is meant to host a simple android app which shows a list of countries with their flags, name and name of their capital cities.
This app shows a simple example of how clean architecture can be used along with model view view-model, along with retrofit, 
coil-image loading/caching and unit tests.
