## Clean Architecture with MVVM

This repository is meant to host a simple Android app that shows a list of countries with their flags, names, and country code, and allows the user to search countries by name.
The purpose of the app is to demonstrate clean architecture with MVVM while not bloating the app with too many features.
The app  uses common libraries such as retrofit and coil-image loading/caching.
There is unit tests in the required sections of the app as well.
