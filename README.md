## Clean Architecture with MVVM

This repository is meant to host a simple Android app that shows a list of countries with their flags, names, and name of their capital cities.
This app shows a simple example of how clean architecture can be used along with model view view-model, retrofit, 
coil-image loading/caching and unit tests.
